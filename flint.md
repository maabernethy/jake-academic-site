# Flint Portfolio

In collaboration with my colleague and friend, [Prof. Eric Schwartz](https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eric-schwartz),
and with the help of [several talented students](https://midas.umich.edu/mdst/) as part of the Michigan Data Science Team, we have
contributed a great deal of statistical and data-oriented work towards recovery efforts in Flint's water crisis. A handful of relevant news
