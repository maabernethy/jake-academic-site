                        2000&nbsp;--&nbsp;</font> (AMHERST) - At 2 p.m. 
                        Saturday, Jake Abernethy will sit for what he hopes 
                        won't be too much of a trial: a final exam on 
                        electricity and magnetism in a University of 
                        Massachusetts physics course. 
                        </p><p>A few hours later, Abernethy, who's somewhat of a 
                        charged particle himself, will enter what he hopes won't 
                        be a trial, for him or anyone else. He'll take the stage 
                        at the Mullins Center with his unicycle, his juggling 
                        clubs, his flaming torches and his ladder. 
                        </p><p>As the opening act for an appearance by the comic <a href="http://www.sinbadnet.com/">Sinbad</a>, Abernethy 
                        will be there to prime the laugh pump. 
                        </p><p>A math major? 
                        </p><p>He's got no theorem to explain it, only a medal whose 
                        enamel has already worn off. 
                        </p><p>In early October, Abernethy, who is 19, was named the 
                        funniest student at UMass in a traveling Comedy 
                        Bake-Off, held at the Fine Arts Center and sponsored by 
                        iCast.com. When he walked onto that stage, Abernethy was 
                        a study in jitters, though that, it turned out, was part 
                        of the act. He improvised his way through a manic five 
                        minutes of juggling and audience-baiting. 
                        </p><p>"I'm going to try and entertain you," he told the 
                        crowd haltingly. 
                        </p><p>He waited a beat. "Why is that funny?" he demanded. 
                        </p><p>When an audience member holding a pin tossed it back, 
                        it fell to the stage. Abernethy gave him a face. 
                        </p><p>"I'll get it," he said. 
                        </p><p>The concert hall that day held a few hundred people. 
                        This weekend's gig may put him before thousands. That's 
                        a big jump from the gatherings of a hundred or so people 
                        he's used to drawing to performances over the past few 
                        years at Faneuil Hall in Boston. 
                        </p><p>"I'm kind of nerved-up about it - and will get more 
                        so before the show," Abernethy said of Saturday's show. 
                        "This is by a huge order of magnitude the biggest thing 
                        I've done. And it might be the peak of my career." 
                        </p><p>Is he joking? Read on. 
                        </p><p>At this fall's comedy contest, Abernethy, who grew up 
                        in Amherst, seemed to get the crowd going in earnest 
                        with a little device honed as a street performer. Rather 
                        than suffer a moment of silence after a juggling club 
                        fell, he leaned into the darkness before him. 
                        </p><p>"Boo me!" he insisted. 
                        </p><p>They laughed. 
                        </p><p>For a juggler, he talks a lot in performance. Or as a 
                        comic, he spends a lot of time tossing props. As an 
                        entertainer, Abernethy knows it's not labels that 
                        matter, it's laughter. 
                        </p><p>
                        </p><p><b>Boston boot camp</b> 
                        </p><p>Though he's been named the funniest student at UMass 
                        (a title Abernethy nicely regards as laughable in 
                        itself), people in classrooms haven't always thought him 
                        funny - or perhaps too much so. A little blowup in math 
                        class in 10th grade, while he was a student at Amherst 
                        Regional High School, led him to leave that campus and 
                        spend half a year in home schooling with his mother, 
                        Meryl Nass. 
                        </p><p>When she moved away to open a medical practice in 
                        Maine, Abernethy went to live in Acton with his father, 
                        John, a physician with the U.S. Department of Veterans 
                        Affairs. The exiled class clown found his way to classes 
                        at Harvard University's extension program and to the 
                        streets, where he honed his teen-age love of juggling. 
                        Boston was his boot camp. 
                        </p><p>Even after an audition earned him a shifting berth 
                        inside the Faneuil Hall market area, Abernethy says he 
                        didn't seem able to hold the crowds that gathered - and 
                        that's key to getting the dollar bills flowing. It 
                        wasn't enough to keep five clubs twirling in midair. By 
                        watching experienced performers work their crowds, 
                        Abernethy found his shtick. 
                        </p><p>He's the nervous, shy guy who may or may not make a 
                        spectacle out of himself. The prospect of a crash and 
                        burn seems to keep people lingering. Oh, and he's 
                        clean-cut, talks 80 miles an hour and leaks boyish 
                        charm. Just to darken it a tad, he sometimes gets a bit 
                        cranky. 
                        </p><p>"I like that kind of character. They see me as 
                        nervous and probably think I'm not a good juggler. Right 
                        then, I've got an advantage," he said. "If I'm not 
                        funny, I still did the trick. The truth is, I hide 
                        behind the fact that I'm a juggler." 
                        </p><p>Ann Rasmussen, the Mullins Center's sales and 
                        marketing manager, said she and others saw similarities 
                        between Sinbad and Abernethy. "Kind of the way they 
                        approach the audience. It's a very energetic, very 
                        physical presence," she said. "We thought it was the 
                        perfect fit." And both performers, she notes, are not 
                        "overly adult" in the content or tone of their shows. 
                        </p><p>To boost ticket sales to college students, the center 
                        is discounting tickets for upper-arena seats with good 
                        visibility. They now cost $16. 
                        </p><p>
                        </p><p><b>Key to comedy</b> 
                        </p><p>Abernethy says he's learned that in the first few 
                        moments of a performance, winning a few scattered laughs 
                        is key. It builds confidence in the other people 
                        watching. His kind of comedy lies not in what the 
                        individual finds funny, but what an audience as a whole 
                        considers humorous. 
                        </p><p>"You can prepare for a stage show, but you can't 
                        prepare for a street show," he said. "Every single day, 
                        it's a different show. The audience is different every 
                        day. Knowing how to work with that is difficult." 
                        </p><p>Abernethy's been at UMass long enough now (three 
                        years) to know the student audience. He knew to slip 
                        several jokes in, while juggling at October's contest, 
                        that were easily, but lightly, taken as sexual 
                        references. 
                        </p><p>Behind the dithering of the shy guy, there's an awful 
                        lot of practice in the physicality of his trade. In a 
                        photo shoot in the Gazette studio, he adjusted 
                        immediately to a low ceiling and juggled clubs while 
                        balancing a unicycle on his nose. He juggled while 
                        riding. He executed a spin while juggling and didn't 
                        miss a club. ("It's a pirouette," he said, "which means 
                        'really difficult' in French.") 
                        </p><p>His desire to dive even deeper into mathematics, his 
                        major, may soon take him to MIT. He postponed an offer 
                        to attend that school this fall, saying he wanted to 
                        finish projects in Amherst, including work as a teaching 
                        assistant, volunteer hours in the public schools and 
                        leadership of the UMass juggling team. Last spring, he 
                        pursued math studies in Budapest, Romania. 
                        </p><p>As for Saturday's show, Abernethy says he'll try to 
                        prepare as little as possible. He'll build his act from 
                        what feels right, right there, under the lights in the 
                        cavernous arena. 
                        </p><p>He'll go home happy, he suspects, and $500 richer. 
                        Will his 20 minutes at the Mullins be a step up and on - 
                        or just an memorable night? 
                        </p><p>He counts himself lucky. "I have friends who tell 
                        math jokes," he said. "That's pretty sad." 
                        </p><p>
