# What kind of crisis is the Flint Water Crisis?

* Public Health?
* Social and Environmental Justice?
* Civil Engineering and Infrastructure?
* Political?
--

* Informational?
  * What do we know? What can we learn?

--

# Enter Data Science ...

* Statistical Machine Learning
* Prediction and Causal Inference

## Quick Quiz and Preview: Flint by the Numbers

(Audience participation!)
--

* What portion of Flint homes have water lead levels above federal EPA 'action level' (15 parts per billion)?
--

.red[ 7 - 10%] <br>
--

* Where are those at-risk homes located in the city?
--

.red[ highly scattered ] <br>
--

* What are the most important risk factor predicting high water lead levels?
--

.red[ there are many: age of property, service line material, home value, city precinct ] <br>
--

* What percentage of homes have lead 'service lines'? 
--

.red[ 4 - 20% ] <br>
--

* Do we know where the lead is located throughout the infrastructure?
--

.red[ not very well ] <br>
--

* What percentage of tested children's blood lead levels are above federal CDC monitoring level 5 ug/dL?
--

.red[ 3 - 6% ]

# Letting the data speak

The nature of problem may be different than headlines may suggest.

--

There is danger and concern in Flint.

--
But not every home is in danger. 

The risk levels vary widely across homes.

--

The problem is: there are many serious cases, and they are scattered around the city.

Finding which homes are in greatest danger is .red[critical],

and that is where statistics, machine learning, and data science help most.

# Today

1. How did we get involved?

1. Tell a story of data and people.

1. Ask questions and use data to find answers.
  * Where are the homes with highest water lead risk?
  * Which homes have lead pipes underground?

1. Guide decision makers and inform residents.

# Finding and combining diverse data sources

## Investigative data science

* Water testing
  1. Residential tests (Department of Environmental Quality, DEQ)
  1. Sentinel site tests (DEQ and Governor's office)
  1. Sequential testing (EPA)

* Parcel information (City of Flint)

* Water infrastructure
  1. City records (via U-M Flint)
  1. In-home inspection (DEQ)
  1. Service lines replaced (Flint Mayor's office)

# Water testing results are public data

# Water testing kit

<img src="water_test_kit.jpg" width=70%>


---

# Water testing data

* Residential testing data
  * Over 15,000 homes submitting over 20,000 water tests.
  * Cross-sectional, with some repeated measures (self-selection)

* Sentinel site testing data
  * About 700 homes selected to be tested 5 times.  
  * Longitudinal repeated measures overtime (random selection?)

* Parcel information

  * Detailed property information about over 40,000 parcels in Flint (address, year built, vacancy, condition, unique key: Parcel ID)

Fewer than 40% of Homes have sampled tested their water. 

What about the rest?

### Predicting the most at-risk homes in Flint

  <iframe src="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jabernet/FlintWater/data_dive_summary_files/significant_risk_houses.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" width=80% height=400></iframe>

We can predict lead levels with 0.677 AUROC score

---
class:top

# How are we predicting water lead levels?

## Classification task

* General Model
  * Y := Is the water lead level greater than 15 ppb?
  * X := Observable property attributes

* Methods: Ensemble of several algorithms.
  * Logistic regression
  * Classification trees and forests
  * Bagging, Bootstrapping, Boosting

---
class:top

# What have we done with those predictions?

We shared these maps and list of most at-risk properties with:

* Flint Mayor's office
* DEQ
* EPA
* NGOs
* U-M Flint 

and we continue to update the results with new data.

Goal: To help decision makers allocate resources for public health communication efforts, targeted testing (water and blood lead levels), and prioritizing infrastructure investment.

### Public portion service line

Hire a company with a hydrovac and start digging (~ $1000)

# City should have records, right?

* The City of Flint did not maintain accurate service line info
* Officials began to search for records as soon as crisis erupted
--

* Records found in basement of City Hall!<br>
<img src="service_line_record_screenshot.png" width="60%"><br>
* These handwritten maps were digitized by Marty Kaufman's group at UM Flint




---
class:top

### City Records are *Highly* Noisy

How do we know?

--

* A recent pilot SL replacement project replaced 33 lines
--

* Michigan DEQ inspected about 3700 *private* service lines, and provided the results.
--

* Confusion matrix of RECORD vs. INSPECTION

## Machine Learning to the Rescue

* At the request of Gen. McDaniel, we have applied learning algorithms to predict service line materials
--

* Model:
  *  Y = *Service line material type* (via DEQ inspection)
  *  X = *Property attributes*, *City Records*, *Water Readings*

--

<center>
  <iframe src="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jabernet/FlintWater/likely_private_LSL.html" width=70% height=200></iframe>
</center>

* We are able to estimate lead with an AUROC score of 0.86 using ensemble of XGBoost and Random Forest classifiers

# What's next?

## Aiding policy makers

* Continue to guide policy and decision makers to help Flint residents.

* Adaptive sampling for lead detection and service line replacement: Which homes and neighborhoods should be examined next?

* Other cities: Flint has attracted national attention to infrastructure and lead issues. How can the methods and findings be applied elsewhere?

---
class:top

# What's next?

## Colllaboration with experts 

* U-M Public health and medicine
  * Lead exposure in 2014-2016 can be used for longitudinal studies in Flint

* U-M Civil engineering
  * Connecting the data analysis to physical tests of pipes, and other chemicals and pathogens in water

* And others...
