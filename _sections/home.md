# About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the
                <a href="https://www.scs.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">School of Computer Science</a> in the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu" target="_blank">College of Computing</a> at the
                <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>.

My research focus is Machine Learning, and I like discovering connections between Optimization,
                Statistics, and Economics. I finished my PhD at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a>
                with <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/" target="_blank">Peter Bartlett</a> in 2011, and I was a
                <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/" target="_Blank">Simons postdoctoral fellow</a>
                with <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/" target="_blank">Michael Kearns</a>
                for the following two years.
